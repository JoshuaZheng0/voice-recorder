# Voice Recorder with React and Tailwind CSS

This project features a voice recorder built with React JS using the `react-mic` library. It allows users to record audio directly from their browser, play back the recordings, and download the audio files for offline use.

## Features
- **Record Audio**: Start and stop audio recordings with intuitive buttons.
- **Playback**: Listen to your recordings with an embedded audio player.
- **Download**: Easily download recorded audio files in `.mp3` format.

## Technologies Used
- **React JS**: For building the interactive user interface and handling audio recording.
- **react-mic**: To manage audio recording functionality.
- **Tailwind CSS**: To style and enhance the UI, providing a clean and responsive design.

## How It Works
- **Start Recording**: Click the “RECORD” button to begin recording audio.
- **Stop Recording**: Click the “STOP” button to end the recording. The audio will automatically be saved and available for playback and download.
- **Download Audio**: After stopping the recording, a download link is provided for saving the audio file.
